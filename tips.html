<h1>Shortcuts and Hacks</h1>
<i><font size=5>Make Your Life Easier</font></i><BR><BR><BR></center>

Welcome to Customer Support.<BR>
Your life will not be easy.<BR>
There is always something going on, and going wrong. Something is always broken, and we work with what we have. By the time we open a 7:30, a horde of customers fill up the seats. After waiting for hours, they begin coming to the front desk with pitchfork and fire.<BR><BR>

Yes, this place is a shark tank. A lot of our tools don't work. HOWEVER, you can make your life easier and the job go faster by learning a few simple tricks, because our computers should help us, not slow us down.<BR><BR>

The shortcuts written about here can be used on both the laptops and the RAPIDS terminals. Many of us know this, but this tutorial was made for the base common denominator - the person who may have not used computers that much before.
