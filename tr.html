<h1>TR (Transactional Register)</h1>
<BR><BR>
The TR is a registry updated daily based on the info in milPDS, and the purpose is to mention any discrepencies.<BR><BR>
Steps to accessing the Transactional Register:<BR>
<ol>
<li>Go to G Drive > Shared > FSS > Squadron Programs > TR Database > TR Database Excel file (the Access file w/ no lock)

<li>After verifying and managing the discrepencies on the printed list, you then must type in a comment onto the TR stating what you have done.
<li>In order to report your actions in the comment box, go onto the TR and select options Customer Service > No Action Taken > [View/Update Records]

<li>Info: Full name, SSN, address<BR><BR>

</ol>

<b>Mismatching addresses</b><BR><BR>

The TR printout states that a member (identified with SSN) has different addresses on milPDS versus what is on DEERS.

<ol>
<li>Get onto DEERS and search the member by SSN, and see if the address on DEERS matches the address listed on the TR printout (which is from milPDS)
<li>After verifying, the addresses will either match in both DEERS and milPDS, or not. 
<li>For matching addresses, mark it off.
<li>For non-matching addresses, you must send the member an email to ask for the correct address, then take note of it.
<li>Afterwards, you will have to get on the TR and write your actions in the comment box.
</ol>

For the matching addresses, write in comment box:<BR><BR>

<textarea rows="2">
Verified in DEERS. Address is up to date. [your initials + day/mon/2019]
</textarea>
then [Exit]
<BR><BR>

For non-matching addresses, write:<BR><BR>

<textarea rows="3">
Contacted member. Advised to update address in vMPF. [your initials + day/mon/2019]
</textarea>
then [Exit]
<BR><BR>
Once finished, you <b>MUST</b> use the [Exit] button in the options to get out of the TR database. DO NOT JUST CLOSE THE X AT THE TOP RIGHT.
<BR><BR>** You can also edit the template in the textboxes, then Copy/Paste the same comment onto the comment boxes each time you open a profile. For example, I will post the same comment for all the profiles with matching addresses, and then copy/paste another comment onto the profiles with non-matching addresses.



<br><br><BR><BR>


<B>When <i>Individuals Country of Original Citizenship is unknown</i>:</B><BR>
<ol>
<li>Check in DEERS to see member's current citizenship
<li>Mark down the members whose citizenship is not US, and what their country of citizenship is
<li> Go to <b><a href="https://milpdsprod.csd.disa.mil/OA_HTML/AppsLogin" target="_blank">milPDS</a></b> and log in with EMAIL certificate

<li>Check Details, then look at the "Citizenship" part. It will state whether the person is a US citizen by birth (Code 1), naturalization (Code 2), etc.
<li>Update Country of Original Citizenship
<BR>* if someone is US citizen in DEERS, milPDS Citizenship states "1", then original citizenship is obviously US<BR>* if someone has foreign citizenship on DEERS, that is usually the <i>country of original citizenship</i>
