prisons are super noisy 24/7, cant even think straight<br><BR>
Father Felix Marquez is a priest from the slums of ____, Texas. He remembers life before the 60 Year War as a young delinquient being raised in the slums.<br><BR>

	<h3>Texas (near San Antonio and Rio Grande Valley)</h3>
Felix was the product of his immigrant mother and her wealthy Chinese employer who took advantage of her when she used to live in the city. Felix and his brother, Roman, grew up playing in the neighborhood with other kids while their parents worked. Their parents were mostly manual laborers and blue collar workers. Older dudes and fathers often came in with dirty work clothes. Mom’s fiancé used to live with the boys and was the father of the 3rd and 4th brothers, and he still lived in the neighborhood and would visit occasionally. The boys’ heads were always shaved to prevent lice. He was rarely around as he had to work, and when he moved, he had his own family too after breaking up with mom - and none of the boys ever met the other family. But, he still came by and took the two young ones out and gave them attention. The two older brothers resented the two younger ones and would pick on them, and the kids helped at a ranch far away. Roman was the child of mom’s boyfriend, who died in a work accident while she was still pregnant, and the neighbor women felt sorry for her and helped her. Mom was an illegal immigrant and still had family back across the border, and she came here alone. The neighbor elderly woman, who was childless (apparently) and mom got close like family, and the grandma would come over and perform rituals and prayers when the children got sick or the young family needed good luck, especially in the midst of police raids. Sometimes when mom was at work in the city, the grandma would babysit the two boys or another neighbor woman would. In other people’s homes, there would often be a TV on, just making noise in the background - even in the middle of the night. As the boys grow up and Felix becomes discontent with his place in life, he grows to resent the elderly woman and the other womens’ belief in religion and rituals, the smell of the rotting eggs in the grandma’s home, the smell of stale sweat in all the trucks and vehicles. He is laying in his bed (more like Roman’s bed but Roman doesn’t come around anymore), and he still hears the faint noise of his neighbor’s TV in the middle of the night mixed with the noise of mouth burning themselves.<br><BR>

<br><BR>When Roman was 15, he got sick of the life and began spending more time outside the home. Mom found out and chastised Roman a lot, who began rebelling and Felix (13) heard them arguing a lot. Roman stopped coming with the family to church. Felix was smart in school, or smart enough to pass without doing much work. But, he got made of for being a nerd, and he looked up to his older brother. They began hanging out together with other boys, and when Roman casually mentioned to one of mom’s friends (after she warns him about a bad omen if he doesn’t do a prayer) that he doesn’t believe in god, she starts crying.

<br><BR>In school, Felix felt the teachers despised the students. As the boys got older, school (which was far away) was an oasis for Felix, and he often tried to stay behind in whatever after school club was funded enough to be available, but his mom was getting agitated. Mom needed Felix to work, and when he came home she’d immediately send him to work.

<br><BR>For the Marquez family, there was no time to think about the long run when it was enough getting through the week.

<br><BR>When Felix was a young teenager(14) at the trailer park with his mother and 3 brothers, he found his father's corporation, demanded to talk to his father. His father denied his existence, telling the young boy not to bother him as he was a very busy man, and Felix told his father to go fuck himself. Felix struggled with the rejection for the rest of his youth. His overworked mother was barely around. He resents Chinese immigrants, who are beneficents of a "friendship program" between the US and China, he thinks they just take advantage of the country. He denies his Chinese side, and considers himself fully Latino (I mean's not wrong). He joined a gang of other young latin men with his elder half brother (he has 3 brothers all from different dads). His community is made of disadvantaged, ignorant, superstitious Mexican Catholics. Grasping with the existence of suffering around him and feeling abandoned by god, he became bitter, and when Felix mentions to his mom that he doesn't believe there's a god, she cries for his soul which annoys him. Even though he knows he should appreciate his mother, he resents her religiosity. One day they are out of electricity again. Felix stares at the oil lamp, which is used because mom gave her jesus candles to an elderly neighbor who had nothing. Felix grows up blaming religion along with other things for keeping people stupid.

	<h3>Gang</h3>
He sold drugs with his gang, who were like family to him, and they fraternized and bonded over the shit they did. Felix gets tattoos, his most prominent is that of a snake and barbed wire. One time there is a stripper who owed them money because she used the drugs for herself, and they wait around the small rural club she works at, and the only bodyguard there doesn't dare to mess with them when they come looking for her. It's a relatively dead club, not a lot of patrons on the monday night, and they go into the dressing room. The other strippers scream and don't fight back, and they find the stripper they're looking for and drag her out of the dressing room and drive her out into the middle of some dumpster. They rape her and felix takes his turn too, her skin is red from the grabbing and slapping (hand marks on her arm) and he sees for a moment her very red labia and her glazed eyes and is creeped out a little, but ignores it because he is horny and closes his eyes and continues fucking her. He is only 16 and never been with a woman before, so he is very eager (most guys from his area lose their virginity at like 13).

	<h3>Prison</h3>
He enters prison at the age of 19 with his half brother and both gangs get annihilated in a racially charged fight among the prisoners (black and latino gangs). As the prisoners fight, COs come in with tazers and batons beating the fuck out of everyone, and in the flurry of fight Felix hears the shouting of the COs and screaming of the tazed prisoners, and that smell of burnt flesh... Felix gets stabbed and his organ punctured - when it went in, he didn't notice it first due to adrenaline, then he felt that deep, sharp, violating sensation. He realized that the body felt the pain the the moment the knife went it, but his conscious mind didn't pay attention to it. He sensed a loss of control over his body and was convinced that this was his last hour, with every heartbeat pushing more blood out of his body, every heartbeat pushing him into the black nothingness.
	<h3>Hospital</h3>
<BR>While recovering at the prison hospital as the sole survivor of the gang, he is treated by a doctor (Dr Guillermo) who is a stark contrast to the manual laborers and farmhands of his neighborhood. The doctor, also Latino (he speaks in spanish to the prisoners), was clean cut, well spoken, and dignified. Even when he was treating prisoners, he treated them with dignity, and didn't treat Felix like he was scum beneath his foot. Felix spends weeks in the hospital bed, wondering why he was the only one who survived when he should've died with the rest of his gang. When Felix is unconscious under painkillers, he grabs the doctor's sleeve and whispers to him (write what Felix says in spanish) - he begs the doctor to help him because he is afraid to die (Felix doesn't remember this). Before a surgery, he wakes up to a priest at his bedside performing the Anointing of the Sick in case that he dies (this is common in this prison with a high Latino population). Felix argues with the priest over the existence of an everwatching God, and tells him that "your God is a son of a bitch".
<BR>After surviving the surgery and recovering for weeks where he was alone with his thoughts, he is sent back to the GP. It is relatively peaceful without his gang and rival gang around, to the point of insanity, and other prisoners leave Felix alone because they don't know how he survived the bloodfest and decide not to mess with him. The guards keep sending him to solitary over the littlest shit, and he goes crazy in there. Felix sees older prisoners who have been there for years, some of them even in wheelchairs, and thinks of what a waste it is to have spent one's life here. He talks to them and realizes how out of touch they are when Felix tries to explain to them what the outer society is like. The lifers, a lot of them now fear the outside world and prefer to stay within the walls. Their most highly prized possessions are faces of women that they tore out from magazines. When Felix masturbates, he used to be into some wild shit, but now even just a mere sight of a woman's face smiling gets him off. He sees a female news anchor on TV and jacks off to it.

	<h3>Parole</h3>
Once Felix gets out of prison at the age of 24, he is overwhelmed by the blueness of the sky, the lushness of the grass. The fresh air, and how it doesn't smell like stale piss. He takes his shoes off and walks around in the grass, feeling the cold wet dew under his feet, and then lays there. People pass by just staring at him.
<BR>He returns back to the trailer park where his mother is and sees that a lot has changed. He works a dead end job and watches TV, fascinated by the new stuff on it and how times have changed. 
<BR>Remembering Dr Guillermo, he wants to be a doctor despite his lack of education and opportunity. But he needs his GED first, and he barely passes when he gets it. 
<BR>He settles for becoming a nurse instead. In order to do this, he has to move out of state and go to Chicago, which the parole gives him so much shit over, but the only nursing program that accepts felons is located there. He packs everything up and move over there with barely anything, and leaves Texas on a bus, which he never left before. Chicago is cold and pricier, and he has roommates. His "hick" accent and vocabulary is already a disadvantage, he shares a flat with 3 other guys. He doesn't trust them simply due to his life experiences. He assumes they will try to steal his shit while he's not looking. He still sleeps with a knife under his pillow. His roommate catches a glimpse of all the tattoos he has, and asks about the big snake one. Felix's explanation is shallow and brief, and the roommate never asks again. Felix knows his roommate saw his stab wound, and already senses alienation and that dreadful feeling of "being caught", but at the same time he desperately hopes that his roommate will ask about it. He wants to spill his story. He goes to a local bar, and it's the first time he can legally buy a drink by himself, and realizes he doesn't know how to order for himself and doesn't understand any of the names of drinks the bartender asks he wants. He picks a random one and overdoes it and starts rambling drunk to strangers about his life in prison, it's like a compulsive need. He struggles to fit in with the wealthier and younger counterparts of his school but keeps pushing on. He lives off campus and takes a train/bus to the school, which is 45 minute away by transit. He has to work on top of that. In Texas, there is only one season: summer, and a hot one at that. Here in Chicago, it is windy and cold and he thinks its the worst it will get (it’s not) in August as the school is about to start. Then during late October, it is his first time seeing snow. He is surprised that it melts immediately when it reaches his skin. When it starts to snow more, he notices it starts piling on his shoulders and stares at it, and notices that it’s true, snowflakes have tiny patterns on them - which melt immediately when he tries to scoop them up with his bare hands. He knew Chicago was going to be cold, but even his “winter clothes” from Texas is nothing in Chicago. He thinks this is the worst cold it’s going to get- and he’s wrong. One time in the city, he misses the bus. He doesn't have proper winter clothes, for this is his first winter. He is shivering, an old couple who have been watching him at the bus stop for a while come out and give him an oversized coat - this is the first kindness someone has shown him. He occasionally visits them at the coffee shop they run, which is right outside the bus, and stay there with a cup of drink he buys from them. As it starts to snow heavily, he is grateful he has a place to get inside while waiting for the bus. He sees the customers coming in and out of the coffee shop in their heavy winter clothes and boots with snow still on them, and he looks out the window (which he drew circles on with his fingers), and is fascinated with the piles and piles of snow. His roommate shows him how to cook basic meals and clean the toilet, and Felix feels sophisticated. He becomes a full fledged nurse in 5 years (29).

	<h3>Chicago Hospital</h3>
As a nurse, Felix deals with patients of all races, including black that he had prejudice against. It doesn't matter what race the patients are - they all bleed, they're all pathetic, they all shit all over the walls, they're all hard to deal with, many of them very rude and ungrateful, dirty and leaves messes for the nurses to clean up (reflection of the human condition...). Felix nearly fights with one and one of the older nurses pull him aside and he tells her he doesn’t know how she and other nurses put up with this shit, and the nurse sighs and tells Felix that these people are dying and dont have much time left, and yes, many of them are stupid and pathetic and it is our job to still take care of them - because if only the good people got help, only a select few people in this world would be alive. She asks where he’s from, thanks to his accent she notices, and when he says Texas, she asks what brought him here. School. Hm, alright. She chuckles and says that this is called a Windy City for a reason, and even though she’s from New York (Bronx), Chicago is its own brand of assholery. Then they talk about the big apple, and that it has everything. What brought her here? She wanted to go elsewhere and was heading to Seattle but ended up halfway in Chicago.
<BR>Felix is sometimes asked to take patients to the other side of the hospital to meet family members, and he spots the hospital chapel along the way, which seems to always have someone there. He is asked by his crippled patient, who reminds him of Grandma to his demise, to take her to the chapel for communion, and the priest at the chapel walks up to her during communion to give her the wafer, and Felix finds it so futile and ugly when he sees her bobbing her head with Parkingsons as she looks up at the priest putting a wafer in her mouth. Felix realizes that there is more faith in a hospital than a church. He feels pity for the people praying to a nonexistent god, because most of them die anyway or continue being sick for the rest of their lives.

	<h3>Professor Burch</h3>
The war starts when Felix is 34. He is the same generation as Sinclair, who is 4 years younger than Felix.
<BR>A year into the war, Felix (35) comes across his former History professor, Professor Burch, who is slowly dying from a genetic disorder (Lupus) that is a ticking time bomb. It started at age 35. Burch has come to the hospital as a patient where Felix works, and invites him to a bar playing jazz. The bar is one of Professor Burch's favorites, he knows the good places in the city. He tells Felix not to worry about paying (for appetizer and drink), and Felix stares down at the glittering city. Everything looks nice on the surface, from afar. But all that is glittering is not gold. He spots the hospital where he works among the city. He realizes that from up here, everything looks so small and insignificant.
<BR>One night they visit at Burch's home, Burch's wife is a doting woman and Felix sees them chuckling like old friends. They have no kids. Felix notices a grand piano in the large living room. Turns out, Burch used to play piano and dreamed of becoming a great pianist, but cannot due to his disease. He notices the wedding photos on the wall, and surprised at how handsome Burch used to be, and how he was standing tall and erect. That night, when talking about the human body, the ethics of using donors, the conversation eventually draws into faith. The professor is a black Catholic who grew up in the South in the bible belt, and Felix tells him how could he think there is a God, because if a god existed, he must've given up on us. Felix points at Burch's illness, and asks why didn't God heal that, what is the point of praying and begging god who isnt going to do anything? Felix brings up the atrocities of the current war, the dying patients in the hospital, what happen to his family, what happen to his brother. Felix pulls up his shirt to reveal his scar, revealing his tattoos along with it. He asks why a God would let these things happen, and what the point of all this is. He has seen enough to know that there is no god, and done too much to rely on a god - if there was a god, he would not have let him do such awful things.
<BR>Felix is still distrusting of people in general. He wonders why Burch is kind to him and wonders what he is getting in return. Did the man have a savior complex? Did he feel superior to him? Why would he hang out with Felix?  Either way, seeing Burch and his wife made him feel more normal, and he began feeling the weight of his past.
<BR>Professor Burch tells Felix that one thing he misses the most about being young and able was dancing, and he met his wife on the dance floor. She was a good dancer. The picture of them young look outdated, the style ridiculous to Felix, but they were happy and thought they looked good.
<BR>His friendship with Professor Burch shows him that there is goodness in this world and that even with suffering and limitations, they cannot stop one from being happy. Burch has accepted his suffering, he loses his dreams, he cannot have kids, but still lives a good life.
<BR>When there is a time when Burch is suffering immensely, which nerve damage (?) rapidly spreading through his body, and everyone believes he is going to die, and Burch has flowers next to his bed and a stereo playing jazz music, which permeates through the floor’s hallway. Felix tries to save him and as a nurse, he realizes how powerless he is. There is not much the doctor, who he admires, can do either. It is night shift for Felix and Burch is in his hospital room and his wife in there sitting next to him all night long, and Felix sits outside in the dark hallway. There is no jazz music playing and only the noise of the machines beeping softly in different rooms and occasional wheels rolling about, otherwise the silence is heavy. It is the only time after years that he feels he doesn’t have a choice and earnestly begins to pray, and he wonders if God would even let him back into his peripheral or even hear him. 

	<h3>Nocturne</h3>
At 38, he is a Nurse Educator, specializing in skin grafting with donor flesh (which is in demand during the wartime). He meets Theodore, a Chicago native and his future protege.
<BR>During his visit back to his hometown in Texas, he volunteers at the local parish as a nurse for the people who cannot afford care. He sees that many things have changed here since he was gone. He realizes how hot the area is. He is adored by the people of the slum, many of them immigrants, many of them unable to speak English. He doesn't visit his family before returning to Chicago.
<BR>When Felix is 40, Burch eventually becomes crippled due to his illness, which should have happen years ago, and Burch says he wants to go to the theatre. His wife dresses him, and she herself dressed like she could’ve come out of Mahogany, and Felix dresses in his formal attire. Felix takes him up in his wheelchair to the theatre, which Burch enjoys. He used to play piano but cannot anymore due to his weak muscles, and when the pianist on stage starts softly playing Nocturne, Felix notices Burch moving his fingers as if he is playing the piano like he used to in his youth.

	<h3>Fr Felix</h3>
Felix eventually becomes a priest at the age of 44 and grew to love Chicago. He goes back to Texas visit his mother. She is now frail, nearly blind and doesn't recognize him. She squeaks softly in Spanish asking who he is. She doesn’t believe him when he says he is Felix, she thought he was dead. 
 
<BR>///////===============

<BR><BR>For Felix Marquez, aware of the Chinese prisoners who are still being exploited for technology, writes to the Vatican in hopes they will publically condemn the use of ES in war, which they do not (yet). The Vatican is also negotiating deals with China, and they do not want to so explicitly agitate the US.

<BR><BR>Felix is diagnosed with cancer from the chemicals while working and living in Texas during his youth, and his rivals know this and hope he dies soon.

<BR><BR>He is a father figure to a lot of the slum children, and his "thugs" are also former delinquents that he has mentored. Even though Felix prays for the strength to be the father he never had on behalf of the children. This is one of his greatest struggles. Felix saves Jack as a child slave who was smuggled into Texas for prostitution and organ harvesting. Jack escapes unscathed thanks to Felix. Theodore, his former student, comes to visit Felix at his cathedral and takes Jack to Chicago where the child can start a new life. Jack becomes a decorated war hero in the future.
 
<BR><BR>Felix has a concealed ____ revolver under his black outfit. He is in love with a nurse who helps him, though they never become an official item. He has a copy of a sculpture that Nikolai made in his office. He has heard of Sinclair.
 
 
<BR><BR>Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.
 
<BR><BR>Father Felix gets shot in the head by the cartel and loses his ability to walk, and when Jack (now a Marine) visits, Jack pushes his wheelchair when they're leaving the hospital. Next time, the ___ finally succeed in assassinating him in the church while Jack is in Ukraine. The cartel comes in wearing their religious icons, and Fr Felix, after being shot, tells them "You wear the cross, but what law of God do you uphold?" before dying. Fr Felix's funeral is one of the funerals that Jack attends in a row after he returns from the war.
 
<BR><BR>The creation of Father Felix (original txt doc was created jan 01, 2017):
<BR><BR>I came up with him first as a "priest with a gun" because my pentecostal mother spoke about how god had the power to turn a thug into a priest, and she often chastised my brother for drawing "gangsta" shit and for drawing a "priest with a gun". I personally found that interesting and it stuck with me, and when I began writing about Jack, I wanted him to be saved by the type of person you would not expect - a manly "priest with a gun". A priest who leads the flock and protects them, but is also strong and has his own past, and was redeemed himself. Especially who is a father figure for children and lost souls. While researching the role of religious figures in poor communities, I came across Pino Puglisi and wanted to base Father Felix off of him. I got the idea about Felix wanting to be a doctor when I read about a doctor (I think Emil Freireich, from a Malcolm Gladwell book) who was a young boy from a poor family, and he admired how smart and clean cut the doctor who was treating him seemed compared to the grime and oil stained men of his working class neighborhood.
