	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
The purpose of this tutorial is to enable any personnelis to take over a task, even if they have never done it before, 
and learn it quickly and independently as required for the mission.<BR><BR>

I made this site for 3 reasons:<ol>

<li>A tutorial that is lightweight and fast to load on even the slowest computer. As a 3F0, there are already lots and lots of information to remember and regulations to follow, last thing we need is to wait for Adobe or Word to load and lag the computer.

<li>A consistent continuity that anyone can pull up from anywhere. It can even be pulled up from your mobile phone.

<li>Easier to understand and use than PSD guides for the most common tasks.
	</ol>	

<BR>For whatever tutorials you are looking for, use <b>[Ctrl]+[F]</b> and then type in your key words, such as "TR" or "DJMS".<BR><BR>
		
<h2>This site is still under construction!</h2>
		
So if you find a dead link, that's why.<BR>
