Sir/Ma'am,

Below is a list of members who have DDLDS and DAS dates that mismatch in MilPDS  & DJMS.
If you have their arrival information please email me a copy so I may create a CMS case to correct their dates. 
If you do not have in-processing docs that reflect their DDLDS and DAS please have the member obtain a travel voucher.
If you have any questions please let me know.
