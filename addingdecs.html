<h1>Adding Decs to milPDS</h1>
<BR><BR>
Decs are often received via mail or email and we manually add them to milPDS when they were not processed through vPC.<BR><BR>
<button onclick="decLegend()">Click Here for the Awards and Decs Listing</button>
<BR><BR>
Steps to adding decs on milPDS:<BR>
<ol>
<li>SF>customer service>cust. support > career enhance. > wards n dec >
<li>F11 > type in last name, first name initial + %  (no space!)> ctrl + f11 >
<li>Here, you'll see AWARDS and DECORATIONS. Refer to the button above and check the list to see what your dec is counted as (awards or decorations).
	<dd>You'll see a list of awards/decs that the member already has.
<li>Verify that the update is already made in milpds, if not, then you'll click the tiny blank space under Details (highlighted and labelled it 1 in picture below)
		and then click the icon at the top left (highlighted and labelled 2 in the picture below)
	<dd><img src="img/addingdecs/addingdec1.PNG"><BR>
	<dd>For AWARDS, it will look like this:

<h2>Decs in the mail</h2><BR><BR>

When we receive decs in the mail, we usually get 2 extra (printed) copies. Update to milpds using steps above, keep 1 copy then mail out other copy to AFPC (if no extra copy just scan it then toss into tab).
<BR>Our copy we scan into share drive.<BR>
Then put physical copy into the binder<BR>
The mail out copy in the correct drawer tab under the printer area (officer vs enlisted)<BR>
<dd>*we send to AFPC so they can update prda, takes 4-6 weeks to reflect on prda</dd>


<BR><BR>
If a mailed dec comes in with a "transittal of decorations" then scan both the dec and the transmittal to put into shared drive, then you can shred it<BR>

In the share drive, save in the relevant folder of the current year starting at the Uploaded Unsorted Mail Outs Folder. The name doesn't matter. The address is:<BR>
<dd>G:\SHARED\FSS\FSP\FSPM\FSPM - Force Management\Mail-Outs\Mail-Outs Uploaded\Uploaded-Unsorted Mail-Outs</dd>
<BR><BR>

<b>Oak leaf clusters</b><BR><BR>

"oak leaf clusters" means its not the first time the member got that specific medal.<BR>
<ol>
<li>Open in milpds > change number to the next number (if 1, then 2)
<li>Change order number to most current one (so the special order at bottom of paper)
<dd>order date
<dd>** headquarter (leave blank)
<dd>start/close date
<dd>app/disa. date
<dd>** leave app/disapp level blank
<dd>condition
<dd>grade
<dd>PAS (if yyy..., then leave blank)
</ol>


<BR><BR>
if a dec comes in a puffy, keep that in note and after processing it, 
put in the binder with the note it came in a puffy, 
then store the puffy in the cabinet<BR><BR>


sometimes we receive decs of people who are not at the base anymore, 
we have to send the dec to the MPF of their next base so they can take care of it
