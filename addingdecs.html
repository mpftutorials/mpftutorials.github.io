<h1>Adding Decs to milPDS</h1>
<BR><BR>
Decs are often received via mail or email and we manually add them to milPDS when they were not processed through vPC.<BR><BR>
<button onclick="decLegend()">Click Here for the Awards and Decs Listing</button>
<BR><BR>
Steps to adding decs on milPDS:<BR>
<ol>
<li>Go to milPDS: Press Ctrl+L, then type in %award and Awards and Decorations should pop up
<li>Find the member: Press the [F11] on keyboard. Enter the SSN with dashes, then Ctrl+[F11]. Columns will populate with the member’s information. Click on member’s name.
	<dd>**If you don't have social, you can also find the member with the % sign at the end.
		<BR>Example: To look for "SNUFFY, BILLY", type something like "SNUFFY, B%" in the name box.</dd>
<li>Here, you'll see member's AWARDS and DECORATIONS where you will see a list of awards/decs that the member already has.
	<BR>Refer to the <i>Awards and Decs Listing</i> button above and check the list to see what your award/decoration.
	<dd>**Use Ctrl + F and type in the award/dec for the milPDS code you are looking for in the list</dd>
<li>Verify that the award/dec is already made in milPDS.
	<BR>If not, then you'll click the tiny blank space under Details (highlighted and labelled it 1 in picture below)
		and then click the icon at the top left (highlighted and labelled 2 in the picture below)
	<dd><img src="img/addingdecs/addingdec1.PNG"></dd><BR><BR>
	For AWARDS, it will look like this:
	<dd><img src="img/addingdecs/addingdec2.PNG"></dd><BR><BR>
	while for Decorations it looks like this:
	<dd><img src="img/addingdecs/addingdec3.PNG"></dd><BR><BR>
	Further explanation on the Decoration input:
	<dd>action: ADD to add a new decoration to the member's profile
	</dd><dd>dec: refer to reference for decorations to find milpds code from the button above
	</dd><dd>num: is how many of the same medal person has (so if first one, its 1)
	</dd><dd>order num: look at "special order' at bottom of the award, then only type in the numbers
	</dd><dd>order date: the "given under my hand date"
	</dd><dd>**skip headquarter
	</dd><dd>start n close date is the one above "accomplishments"
	</dd><dd>app/disapprov. date is same as order date
	</dd><dd>**leave app/dis. level blank
	</dd><dd>condition is at the bottom - condition matters because if they're retiring/pcsing we need to know what its for
	</dd><dd>grade is the dude's rank
	</dd><dd>pas - at the bottom but if just yyyy, skip
	</dd><dd>service component: always R (active duty)</dd>
<li> Then Save.
</ol>
<BR>

<h2>Other miscellanous things regarding decorations</h2>
	
<h3>What are devices??</h3><BR><BR>

A device is an addition to the Award or ribbon that the member is given.<BR><BR>
	
<h3>What are Oak Leaf Clusters??</h3><BR><BR>
You'll notice that some Decorations come with things like 1OLC or 2OLC. "oak leaf clusters" means its not the first time the member got that specific medal.<BR>
<ol>
<li>Open in milpds > change number to the next number (if 1, then 2)
<li>Change order number to most current one (so the special order at bottom of paper)
<dd>order date
<dd>** headquarter (leave blank)
<dd>start/close date
<dd>app/disa. date
<dd>** leave app/disapp level blank
<dd>condition
<dd>grade
<dd>PAS (if yyy..., then leave blank)
</ol>

<h2>Criteria to add ribbons to member's vMPF/milPDS profile</h2><BR><BR>
	Often we will get emails from customers and CSS stating that their ribbons are missing, or they were awarded a ribbon or decoration and need to get it added to their profile.<BR>
	In order to update the profiles, we need verifications from the members or their CSS showing that they qualify for the awards/decs.
<h3>Frequently asked questions:</h3>

<table>
  <tr><th>
	  Customer's question: Hi, I got deployed overseas and qualified for a <B>short tour ribbon</b>. What do I need to provide to get that updated in my profile?
  </th></tr>
  <tr><td>
	  <b>What to do:</b> The customer will need to provide any documentation that shows that they were overseas for 300+ days within an 18-month time span.

Hello AFPC,

We have a member who needs their PRDA/milPDS updated. [Their promotion board is coming up soon], [They are retiring soon], [Our office printer is not working with no ETA of fixing the issue so we cannot send it via mail.]

Please update on our behalf, or let us know if you need anything else.

	Member Rank/Name: 
	SSN:
	Decoration Type: 
	Inclusive Dates: 

v/r,

</textarea><BR><BR>

Send e-mail from org box not your own email address.<BR>
Then in vPC, though you didn't update the milPDS yourself, submit to AFPC the eval rating + milpds update date<BR>

<!---------------------------------	Decs in the mail ----------------------------------->
<h2>Decs in the mail</h2><BR><BR>

When we receive decs in the mail, we usually get 2 extra (printed) copies. Update to milpds using steps above, keep 1 copy then mail out other copy to AFPC (if no extra copy just scan it then toss into tab).
<BR>Our copy we scan into share drive.<BR>
Then put physical copy into the binder<BR>
The mail out copy in the correct drawer tab under the printer area (officer vs enlisted)<BR>
<dd>*we send to AFPC so they can update prda, takes 4-6 weeks to reflect on prda</dd>


<BR><BR>
If a mailed dec comes in with a "transittal of decorations" then scan both the dec and the transmittal to put into shared drive, then you can shred it<BR>

In the share drive, save in the relevant folder of the current year starting at the Uploaded Unsorted Mail Outs Folder. The name doesn't matter. The address is:<BR>
<dd>G:\SHARED\FSS\FSP\FSPM\FSPM - Force Management\Mail-Outs\Mail-Outs Uploaded\Uploaded-Unsorted Mail-Outs</dd>
<BR><BR>




<BR><BR>
if a dec comes in a puffy, keep that in note and after processing it, 
put in the binder with the note it came in a puffy, 
then store the puffy in the cabinet<BR><BR>


sometimes we receive decs of people who are not at the base anymore, 
we have to send the dec to the MPF of their next base so they can take care of it
