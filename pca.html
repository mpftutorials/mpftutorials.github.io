<h1>PCA (Permanent Change of Assignment) Update</h1>

Air Force mission may require local moves of individuals to perform duty in a different manpower position at the same location, 
these moves are unfunded, tracked closely on the AF IMT 2096, Classification-On–the-Job Training Action and updated in MilPDS 
to ensure accountability. Some of these moves are within the same command and within the same duty location whereas some are not.<BR>
This guide explains the difference between an Intra-Command PCA and an Inter-Command PCA, and defines the responsibilities of each.<BR>

<h2> PCA without PCS</h2>
PCA without PCS are accomplished in two methods:<BR>
 <dd>Airmen permanently reassigned from one organization to another organization located on the same permanent duty station.</dd>
 <dd>Airmen permanently reassigned from one permanent duty station to another (the duty location [codes] are different) is normally a PCS, 
 except when both locations are within the corporate limits of the same city or town. The rules for management of a PCS do not apply for a PCA without PCS entitlements.
</dd>

<h2>Intra-Command PCA</h2>
An Intra-command PCA reassignment occurs when Airmen change units (assignment) on the same installation and the servicing major command (MAJCOM) does not change.<BR><BR>
Intra-command PCA actions change unit of assignment, organization, position number, duty effective date and supervisor. Intra-command PCA actions directly affect strength accountability. The losing unit initiates the PCA actions with information provided by the gaining unit. Losing units complete an AF IMT 2096 or an “Intra-MPF Assignment Action” system-generated RIP and forwards it to the MPS. The MPS updates the duty information in the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS). The MPS mails the AF IMT 2096 or RIP for file in the Automated Records Management System (ARMS) in accordance with the ARMS Residual Records PSD Guide.
<BR><BR>
An inter-command PCA reassignment occurs when an Airman changes units (assignment) on the same installation, and the servicing MAJCOM changes. For accountability purposes, a no-cost PCS is updated into MilPDS. No action is required on the assignment notification RIP. This allows systematic updating of the Airman's personnel data record to transfer from the losing unit and update on the gaining unit.
<BR><BR>
Inter-command PCA actions change the unit of assignment, organization, MAJCOM, position number, duty effective date and supervisor. Inter-command PCA actions directly affect strength accountability. The losing unit initiates the PCA actions with information provided by the gaining unit. The losing unit completes the AF IMT 2096 and forwards to the MPS. The MPS updates the duty information in MilPDS. NOTE: If the MAJCOM change is not projected in MilPDS, the MPS must forward a Case Management System (CMS) request to AFPC approval). The MPS forwards the AF IMT 2096 for file in the Automated Records Management System (ARMS) in accordance with ARMS Residual Records PSD Guide.
