<!----------------------------------------- Evals on vPC ----------------------------------------->
<h1>Processing Evaluations (EPRs/OPRs) on vPC</h1>

<h2>AB-TSgt evals</h2>
There are 3 places involved with EPR updates: <a href="https://mypers.af.mil/app/processes/form/fn/vdb">vPC</a> where you actually find the EPRs, milPDS to update on, then SHARED DRIVE where you will save a copy of the EPR from vPC.
	<BR><BR>
The evals are a bit different for AB-TSgt and MSgt+.
	<BR><BR>
First, go on <a href="https://mypers.af.mil/app/processes/form/fn/vdb">vPC</a>:
	<ol>
	<li>Mypers > vpc > worklist tab > Type (evaluation) > double click on a name > pull up pdf
	<li>Save the PDF somewhere you can find it (I just save mine on Desktop), the file name format is <b>[FORM][LASTNAME][FIRST INITIAL][LAST4SSN][closing date YEARMODA]</b>, no space
	</ol>
Then without closing out of vPC, go to milPDS:
	<ol>
	<li>eval (enlisted) > look them up
	<li>eval tab > details > look for something that says "proj" >
		<dd>ensure dates match, change status to CLOS,</dd>
		<dd>no. of days not rated (usually 0)</dd>
		<dd>rating (ctrlf OVERALL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT (the boxes))
			<dd>**AB-Tsgt (form af910) looks different than MSgt-SMSgt (form af911), and officer (form af707)</dd></dd>
		<dd>input promotion recommendation (if blank, NR)</dd>
		<dd>Senior Rater ID: ctrlf FDID then copy/paste the first 5 letters/nums</dd>
	</ol>
Back on vPC:
	<ol>
	<li>In the tab "MPS Actions"
	<li>Fill in:
		<dd>eval rating (its on PDF)</dd>
		<dd>MilPDS updated (just press calender then ok for todays date)</dd>
	<li>Forward to AFPC
	<li>Take the PDF you saved (wherever you saved it) and place into the Saved Eval. [current year] folder
	</ol><BR>

<hr>	
<h2>MSgt+ evals</h2>
MSgt+ evals are slightly different from the ones to AB-TSgt because you'll be inputting different information from the EPR into milPDS and the EPRs even look a bit different.
	<BR><BR>
Go on <a href="https://mypers.af.mil/app/processes/form/fn/vdb">vPC</a>:
	<ol>
	<li>Mypers > vpc > worklist tab > Type (evaluation) > double click on a name > pull up pdf
	<li>Save the PDF somewhere you can find it (I just save mine on Desktop), the file name format is <b>[FORM][LASTNAME][FIRST INITIAL][LAST4SSN][closing date YEARMODA]</b>, no space
	</ol>
Then without closing out of vPC, go to milPDS:
	<ol>
	<li>eval (enlisted) > look them up
	<li>eval tab > details > look for something that says "proj" >
		<dd>ensure dates match, change status to CLOS,</dd>
		<dd>no. of days not rated</dd>
		<dd>rating (ctrlf OVERALL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT (the boxes))
			<dd>**AB-Tsgt (form af910) looks different than MSgt-SMSgt (form af911), and officer (form af707)</dd></dd>
		<dd>promotion rec: leave blank for AF911s</dd>
		<dd>final eval: ctrl f "FINAL EVAL" and see who is under it. deputy is B, for example</dd>
		<dd>Senior rater ID: ctrlf SRID (its at top) then write exactly as is into milpds</dd>
		<dd>Sr Rater Strat: ctrlf SENIOR RATER STRAT and see whats there. if blank, type C in milpds</dd>
	</ol>
Back on vPC:
	<ol>
	<li>In the tab "MPS Actions"
	<li>Fill in:
		<dd>eval rating (its on PDF) </dd>
		<dd>Endorser position</dd>
		<dd>MilPDS updated (just press calender then ok for todays date)</dd>
	<li> Forward to AFPC
	<li>Take the PDF you saved (wherever you saved it) and place into the Saved Eval. [current year] folder
	</ol><BR>

<h2>Officer Evals</h2>
	<BR><BR>
	go on vPC:
	<ol>
	<li>Mypers > vpc > worklist tab > Type (evaluation) > double click on a name > pull up pdf
	<li>save pdf , format is > [FORM][LASTNAME][FIRST INITIAL][LAST4SSN][closing date YEARMODA] no space
	<BR><BR>
	then on milpds:
	<BR><BR>
	<li>eval (officer) > look them up
	<li>eval tab > details > look for something that says "proj" >	
		<dd>ensure dates match, change status to CLOS,</dd>
		<dd>enter no of days not rated</dd>
		<dd>input perf indicator (Y if meets and the "DOES NOT MEET STANDARDS" are blank)</dd>
		<dd>history control OPR Is always E</dd>
	</ol>
	<br><br>if a person PCSed and doesn't show up on milpds, then save the PDF to drive (PCS folder), then the eval to their new base force management.

<h1>Emailing PCSed Evals to the FSMPM of the next base</h1>
<BR><BR>



<ol>
<li>Go to AMS > select MPF > Personnel Information > Member Search > type SSN
<li>Save EPR with (their new base) in parenthesis on the file name
<li> To find POC of FM at their base, go to:

<dd>then the Excel file: mailing addresses all addresses updated</dd>
<li>CtrlF the base, look at ADDRESS then search on Outlook's Global address list (format: 65 fsf/fsmp) to find either the FM or specifically the eval's org box.
