<li>Mypers > vpc > worklist tab > "Type" in action request box > search for "decorations" then press refresh
<li>Select aname and push "open request to finalize" under the list
<li>>PREVIEW DECORATIONS, PRESS PREV. DEC. AWARD
	<dd>[image here]</dd>
<li>Refer to this Decoration Review Checklist to ensure everything on the preview looks good:
	<dd><button onclick="checklist()">Click Here for the Decoration Review Checklist</button></dd>
	<dd>If good, save in the respective folder (w/ Preview)</dd>
	<dd>If not good, return to the CSS with a statement on what needs to be fixed. Then, move onto the next decoration.</dd>
<li>If good, go back on vPC and press the order number to generate order #
	<dd>Save in the respective folder for final copies</dd>
<li>Back on vPC after the push date populates, close out and move onto the next decoration.
</ol>
	
<b>IF THERE IS ERROR WHEN YOU PUSH</B>, read the error. Examples of errors what it means and what you need to do:
<ul>
	<li><B>ORA-20001: decor_validation: N, err_msg, Cannot input same number while adding</b>
		<dd>This error means that the "Decoration Count" is wrong because there are already a previous decoration of the same kind before it.<BR>
			For example, let's say a member has an AFAM already, but the site (for a new AFAM) says "Decoration Count: 1", it means the Decoration Count
			should be 2 because the member alerady has an AFAM and this current site is pushing for a second AFAM, not a first one.</dd>
	<li><B>The document upload failed.  ARMS has indicated that this document already exists for this service member during this evaluation period.
		You will need to remove the existing document from ARMS before this document can be uploaded.</b>
		<dd>This means that this decoration already exists in PRDA and milPDS. 
			<br>This often happens as a glitch while pushing the decoration, where vPC will push
			the site twice and duplicate its request. <BR>
			In this case, save the copy of the final version of the decoration onto your desktop or folder, and then
			return the site back to the CSS so they can close it.</dd>
	<li><b>196-68-1829: MilPDS Error: ORA-20001: decor_validation: N, err_msg, 
		Cannot input decoration data on projected records or gains until the complete record has been received from HAF</b>
		<dd>I have no idea what this means</dd>
