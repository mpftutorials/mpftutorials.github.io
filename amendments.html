<!-------------------------- OPA Amendments -------------------->
	
<h2>Orders Processing Application (OPA) Amendments</h2><BR>
	
<BR>The Orders Processing Application on vMPF is easy, it does most of the work for you.
<BR>
<BR>You can access OPA through <a href="https://w45.afpc.randolph.af.mil/AFPCSecureNet40/CheckPortal.aspx" target="_blank">vMPF under the “Self Service Actions” tab</a>.
<BR>
<BR>People will normally ask for amendments to add dependents 
	or funding information for TDYs (must include dates, course ID, fund cite, LOA, and per diem info. They should have a memo that has this info). 
	If the TDY is AETC funded, check box 7!!!
<BR>
<BR>Before adding dependents, make sure to verify them on their 1172. 
	They must have been a dependent prior to arrival to Scott. 
	They cannot add a spouse they married while already stationed here because it will cause travel voucher issues.
<BR>
<BR>Make sure to email the org box and let SSgt Lopez or TSgt Colon (or whoever the approving official is) that you created an amendment that needs reviewed and signed.
<BR>
<BR>You will get an email when the amendment has been authenticated, LET THE MEMBER KNOW and CC the org box.
