ALCON,

The monthly SDAP roster is attached. Your patience has been greatly appreciated while we were in maintenance from being removed from our EIM site. Please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns or cannot meet the suspense.



***Please read thoroughly and utilize the following instructions to process your monthly reviews:

1.	Open attached document “SDAP Monthly Recertification Memo Template”
a.	SAVE this document to your desktop; you will use it EVERY month. Remember to use your unit’s appropriate letterhead. Directions on what to edit are highlighted on the document. You do NOT need to annotate members that do not have any changes. If NO ONE requires changes please annotate “No changes to report.”
2.	Open the respective months SDAP Excel document
a.	Review each name (that is not already “blacked-out” and ensure the monthly information for that member is correct. Information that is “blacked-out” has already been reviewed by the SDAP technician and has been verified as “No Action Required-NAR” from the Unit CC. *If your monthly roster does not have any visible members then no action is required and you do not need your Unit CC to sign the “SDAP Monthly Recertification Memo Template” however; if you are missing a member that should appear on the monthly SDAP roster please annotate on the recertification memo and email the signed memo to 375FSS.FORCEMANAGEMENT@us.af.mil. 
3.	Annotate ANY information on the recertification memo that is NOT appearing correct on your Excel roster. DO NOT EDIT EXCEL DOCUMENT! Provide a DRAFTED AF FORM 2096 to the 375 FSS/FSPM Force Management Organizational email (375FSS.FORCEMANAGEMENT@us.af.mil) for initial review; we will then email you back to obtain signatures if a 2096 is in fact needed. If a 2096 has previously been sent to the Org box please annotate this on the memo with the original date it was sent; a duplicate 2096 is not needed unless requested by the SDAP technician.
4.	Email your unit’s recertification memo, signed by the unit commander or equivalent (must be on G-Series orders).

Very Respectfully,

YOURNAME, A1C, USAF
Force Management Technician
375th Force Support Squadron
